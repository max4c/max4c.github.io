            <h2>Tools</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy tools that are pieces of art in and of themselves. This page is inspired by Kevin
                    Kelly's <a href="https://kk.org/cooltools/">CoolTools</a> site.
                    Below is a continually updated list of tools I use in my personal and professional life that spark
                    joy.

                        on Macos. My pointer speed is 0.13, do not go to the max speed as it will be extremely hard to
                        reset it </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.notion.so/product/calendar">Notion Calendar</a> - Good design. I preferred

                        chose colemak as my keyboard layout and enjoy it so
                        much. Instead of looking at a diagram of where letters are, I just started completely fresh on
                        monkeytype and looked at the screen and let muscle memory develop over time. After 2 years,
                        I am floating around 84 wpm with 96% accuracy</li>
