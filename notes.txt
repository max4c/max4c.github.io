Metalearning
<p>
I significantly enjoy learning about experts and masters of any field.
This interest has grown in part, thanks to Tim Ferriss' podcast and my high school education in the
liberal arts.
Three pieces of an expert's workflow are at the center of my learning, namely:

<li>What their routines are</li>
<li>What tools they use</li>
</ul>

Create an experts/metalearning tab about all the experts that inspire metalearning
