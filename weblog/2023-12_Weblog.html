    <p>December 2023, Provo<br><br></p>
    <div class="profile-text">
      <p>When building this site, I couldn't decide if I wanted to have the public repository of 
        my ideas to have the name: notes, essays, ideas, posts, articles, or blog. As this site 
        ,and a large part of my life, is focused on doing only what is necessary, I chatted with GPT-4
        to see which name would work best when the only consistent parts of each entry would be the date and title.
        I came to find out that the word <b>blog</b> is a truncation of the word <b>weblog</b>, similar to a ship's log 
        where daily occurrences or thoughts are recorded.
        <br><br></p>
        <p>As this is the web,<br><br></p> 
        <p>and here is a chronological list of my ideas,<br><br></p>
        <p>I landed on weblog.</p>
