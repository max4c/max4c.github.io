                <p>I've used the Apple Watch for one year and the Whoop for one year.</p>
                <p>The Apple Watch can be configured to remove almost every notification, so it serves just as a
                    sleep/fitness tracker.<br><br></p>
                <p>The main downside, and the reason I don't use it anymore, is the constant need to remove and charge
                    it. Approximately one day of battery life became really annoying to me, and I don't want the larger
                    Ultra model.<br><br></p>
                <p>The Whoop is almost perfect for me because I never have to remove it—the charger clips on—and it only
                    needs to be charged every three to four days. I forget it's on my wrist, and I find the insights
                    helpful. For instance, I am now sleeping nine hours instead of eight because my recovery was
                    consistently low, and now I'm feeling much better throughout the day. The main downside is that it
                    takes the place of a watch but has no screen to tell time. Personally, a Whoop with a small,
                    discreet screen to display the time would be perfect. I really don't like the look of a watch and a
                    Whoop on either arm or on both arms. Also, the subscription model is extremely hard to justify when
                    features aren't changing fast enough for me.<br><br></p>
                <p>My subscription renewal for Whoop is coming up soon, and I am going to cancel and see how things go
                    without a wearable. Depending on how that goes, I'll either go back to Whoop, or try out a Garmin
                    Forerunner or a Coros Pace 3, as I enjoy trail running.<br><br></p>
