      <p>You don’t rise to the level of your intentions, you fall to the level of your accountability. - August Bradley
      </p>
      <p>Fashions fade, style is eternal. - Yves Saint Laurent</p>
      <p>Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house a world; and beyond its world, a heaven. Build
        therefore your own world. - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
      <p>Oh, how can we pamper our appetites upon luxuries drawn from reluctant fingers?
        Oh, could slavery exist long if it did not sit on a commercial throne?
        …Oh, friend, beneath the most delicate preparations of the cane can you not see the stinging lash and clotted
        whip?
        I have reason to be thankful that I am able to give a little more for a Free Labor dress, if it is coarser.
        I can thank God that upon its warp and woof I see no stain of blood and tears; - Ellen F. Watkins

      <p>The only factor becoming scarce in a world of abundance is human attention – Kevin Kelly</p>
      <p>And the truth is that as a man’s real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows
        narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do. - Master Summoner from A
        Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
      <p>What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.- Werner Heisenberg</p>
      <p>Time makes more converts than reason - Thomas Paine</p>
      <p>I shall content myself with merely, declaring my firm conviction that for the seeker, who would live in fear of
        God, and who would see him face-to-face restraint in diet, both as to quantity, and quality, is as essential as
        restraint in thought and speech - M. K. Gandhi</p>
      <p>Poor planning on your part does not necessitate an emergency on mine. ― Bob Carter</p>
      <p>Never let a problem be solved become more important than a person to be loved - Thomas S. Monson</p>
