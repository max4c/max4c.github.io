        <p>If I'm not programming or moving my body, I'm likely reading.
          Over the years, I've recommended songs, movies, and experiences many times, but never really books.
          To amend this, below is a ongoing master list of books I recommend. <br><br></p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://a.co/d/76qPWCM">Out of the Silent Planet</a> - the only scifi by C.S. lewis I am aware

              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexport">Flexport</a> recommended it during a YC meetup</li>
          <li><a href="https://a.co/d/eD1kLf2">Outlive</a> - The most in-depth and thorough book on longevity I've
            found.</li>
          <li><a href="https://a.co/d/it0c708">Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</a> - Hope and courage of the

          <li><a href="https://a.co/d/2Dpgo5s">The Story of My Experiments with Truth</a> - Gandhi's renunciations are
            as equally thought provoking as his dedication to public work.</li>
          <li><a href="https://a.co/d/ez8IuK9">The Three Musketeers</a> - I audibly laughed and gasped an inordinate
            amount of times during this book.</li>
          <li><a href="https://a.co/d/a8w0qkT">The Brothers Karamazov</a> - Oddly similar to Out of the Silent Planet,
            yet in Russia, and very intense. Sensual, Spiritual, and Intellectual confront trauma. (I hope to write
            about the similarity one day)</li>
          <li><a href="https://a.co/d/h9B7jAd">The 4-Hour Workweek</a> - One of the defining causes of my entrepreurial
            seizure.</li>

            also in the depth of one. Surpass the plateau and you discover the exhilaration of the quest for ongoing

          <li><a href="https://a.co/d/j9GceNu">The Body Keeps the Score</a> An engaging history of mental health

            must.</li>
          <li><a href="https://a.co/d/9elEOd4">Essentialism</a> - This book helped me to learn to say no. It has helped

            and means of discovery in analytical fields!</li>
          <li><a href="https://chipwilson.com/book">The Story of Lululemon</a> My favorite quote: There are two parts to
            a successful business. First, there are the product and customer. This is the part the entrepreneur knows
            better than anyone in the world.
            Second, there is the business of public board governance. It includes the Machiavellian power moves and
            survival struggles of top executives and board members.</li>
